# Rotten-Food-detection
We have developed an image processing algorithm which captures the image of fruit/vegetable and gives us approximately how much time left before rotting.

So in this Project, discussion of designing such a technique/algorithm including image processing and its combination with weight loss percentage method
is done which will help to alert the person before time when food items start rotting. This will alert the person so that food items can be consumed at the right time and thus food wastage will be reduced. Keywords: Food wastage, Image processing, Canny edge detection, Weight loss percentage.
